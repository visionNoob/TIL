00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
Hi, next these are dividing functions. We will look at dividing function already

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,240
I have few videos on the decreasing functions

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,000
Now this is called as dividing function reason if you see in the algorithm or a function

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,600
It is calling itself for n by 2 if n is passed then it is

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,060
Dividing n see if our algorithm is taking any parameter. Let us say n

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:29,980
then it can reduce the value of n by either n minus 1 that is subtracting

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,360
or decreasing or n by 2 that is a dividing or

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,360
root n that is root function

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:46,580
Right so for all these we can have different type of functions where the algorithm or a recursive function is calling itself again

10
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,620
by root value of n or

11
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:56,060
Divided value of n or decreased value of n so already we have decreased value of n functions now

12
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,680
This is dividing value of the function if you have not seen those videos

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,000
You can watch them now. Let us solve this one

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,800
Let us prepare a recurrence relation. We will say this algorithm takes a t n time and

15
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:16,100
There are two statements inside this one so this takes one unit of time and when this is a t n

16
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,820
What is this t n by 2?

17
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:27,080
Then what is the equation t n is equals to these two so this is t n by 2?

18
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,500
plus 1

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,140
That's the recurrence relation now. Let us write that recurrence relation here t n is equals to

20
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,900
t n by 2

21
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,460
plus 1

22
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,980
when n is

23
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,680
See if you observe here. I have written 1 I

24
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,380
Have written 1 so if n is greater than 1 this is happening

25
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:59,660
If n is equal to 1 then nothing so I can take constant or

26
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,940
write 1

27
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:02,880
constant

28
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,260
This is the recurrence relation now. Let us solve this one by using tree method

29
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,740
recursion tree method

30
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,120
t n is called

31
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:22,280
What are the steps 1 and t n by 2 so this is 1 and this is t n by 2?

32
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,160
How much time t n takes 1 plus whatever the time taken by this we don't know the time for this one

33
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:36,640
So what is this this is 1 plus t n by 2 squared so that is n by 2 by 2 again

34
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:43,620
So this one is 1 t n by 2 cubed

35
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:53,280
How long we will continue we say that we'll continue for k times so if we continue for k times then this will be

36
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,160
t of n by 2 power k

37
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:05,640
See when this is getting divided and divided and divided at last what we will get

38
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:11,380
The unity value or the unit value for division and multiplication is 1

39
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,340
so it should stop at 1 and

40
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,060
We know when n is equals to 1 answer is 1

41
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,540
So the purpose of go on dividing is to reach that 1

42
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:29,940
So we assume that we have reached till n by 2 power k that is equal to 1

43
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,780
So now let us see what is the time

44
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:41,140
See in this it is one step then one step in each there is only one step one step

45
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:47,760
How many times this will take one one step total how many steps are there so we are doing it for k times

46
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,280
So these are k steps

47
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:52,780
So

48
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:59,200
It means time is k so it depends on the number of steps or the number of levels that this tree is having

49
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,140
So that is equal to k see this one time then two time then three time up to k times

50
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,960
Right and we know that n by 2 power k is equals to 1

51
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,200
Since n by 2 power k is equals to 1

52
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,040
Then this is n is equals to 2 power k then what is k?

53
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,420
k is equals to log n base 2

54
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,180
You send this power base to this side. So it becomes log n base 2

55
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,020
See, I'll write here if 2 power 5 is

56
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,140
32

57
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,620
Then 5 is equals to log 32 base 2

58
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,100
Log 32 base 2

59
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:54,620
Right, so it means if you have a power b is equals to c then b is equals to log

60
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,820
c base a

61
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,620
So same way 2 power k is equals to n

62
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:08,280
2 power k is equals to n then k is equals to log n base 2 log n base 2

63
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:14,380
So that's it. How many steps it is taking k steps. So what is the time taken?

64
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,080
Log n k k is log n so the answer for this is

65
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,640
Order of log n or say big O of log n

66
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:32,040
So that's it this is using tree method now, let us solve the same thing using substitution method

67
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,740
Let us solve this by substitution

68
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,500
T n is equals to

69
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,480
T n by 2

70
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,330
Plus 1 this is the first equation

71
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:55,380
Then what is T n by 2? See since T n is equals to T n by 2 plus 1

72
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:04,140
Then T n by 2 will be what T n by 2 by 2 so n by 2 square plus 1

73
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,660
So we can substitute this one here

74
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:17,940
So this becomes what T n is equals to T n by 2 square plus 1

75
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,140
This one then plus 1 as it is

76
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:30,600
T n is equals to T n by 2 square plus 1 plus 1 2

77
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:36,060
I'm adding them because these are just constant values 1 1 so I'm adding them

78
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,780
So it means in the next step what I get

79
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:46,350
This is second one. So it means in next step what I get T n is equals to

80
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,800
T n by 2 cube

81
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,000
plus 3

82
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,520
If we continue doing this then what I get

83
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,460
T n is equals to T n by 2 power k

84
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,360
plus k

85
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,700
Fourth equation

86
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,620
T n is equals to T n by 2 power k plus k

87
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:22,260
T n is equals to T n by 2 power k plus k

88
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:30,700
Now we assume that n by 2 power k has became 1 that is n is equals to 1 so we assume this one

89
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:38,700
n by 2 power k is equals to 1 because we are reducing it and reducing it up to 1

90
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:45,180
So this has become 1 so therefore n is equals to 2 power k and

91
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,480
k is equals to log n

92
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,120
Now take that one T n is equals to T

93
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,980
1 plus what is k log n

94
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,580
T n is equals to what is the T 1 T 1 is 1

95
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,360
1 plus log n

96
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,260
That's it. This is theta or big O of n

97
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,960
So we got the same answer

98
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,260
So that's it this form of equation recurrence relation

99
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,500
We are getting the answer as log n

100
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,660
So we have solved using tree method as well as substitute substitution or induction method

101
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:37,080
And we also have a master theorem for this one. So we will see few recurrence relations

102
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,500
So then we will see Masters theorem for this one
