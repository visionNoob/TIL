00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
Now next video, characteristics of algorithm. What are the characteristics?

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:11,560
What are the properties of an algorithm? So let us check. First one, algorithm

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:16,920
must take some input. So algorithm, some algorithm may not take any input also

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:29,780
but algorithm can take zero or more input. They can take zero or more input.

5
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:37,800
The next, output. Algorithm must generate at least one output otherwise it's no

6
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,280
use of writing algorithm. It must generate some result. See imagine them

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,900
like a function, C language function. Like when you call a function, function

8
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:53,160
may not take any parameters also but function returns something. If it's not

9
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,560
returning we say void but it does something definitely. If it is

10
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,880
return type like but the function gives some result definitely. That's what is

11
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:23,660
the output. At least one output. Then definiteness. Every statement should be

12
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:32,040
unambiguous and it should have a single and exact meaning. You cannot write any

13
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,840
statement which cannot be understood or which cannot be solved. Like if the

14
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,380
human cannot solve it, we can't ask our computers to solve that one. So every

15
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,780
statement that you're writing should be definite. That's clear. So definiteness.

16
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,460
You cannot use the value. For example I tell you, you cannot use the value

17
00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:03,200
that suppose root minus one. It's unknown value. Unknown value. So we say it as

18
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,420
imaginary number. So you cannot treat it as a real number and in the

19
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:15,100
algorithm. Right? This is an example I'm giving you. So every statement must give clear meaning.

20
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:21,080
Only one meaning. That's it. Then next is finiteness. Algorithm is just like a

21
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,700
function as I said. A function will have some limited set of steps and it

22
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,740
will stop and returns the result. So same way algorithm must terminate at

23
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:34,340
some point. Whether it may be having 10 statements or maybe having 10,000

24
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:40,580
statement but it must have finite set of statement. The duration of algorithm

25
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:45,460
must be finite. Definitely we'll stop writing after some statements you may

26
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:51,140
stop. But the meaning here is that there are some programs which runs

27
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:57,080
continuously unless and until you stop them. Like example database server.

28
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,000
Oracle server you start and if you leave the machine as it is and don't

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,980
stop it then Oracle server will be keep on running. SQL server it will be keep on

30
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:14,220
running. It's like a service. Web server keep on running. So it is not a service.

31
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:22,120
It's an algorithm. It's a procedure. So it must stop. Then effectiveness. Now this is

32
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,800
simple. You should not write unnecessary statements in an algorithm.

33
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,920
Whatever the statement you write the objective is that it should do

34
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,100
something, serve some purpose in the procedure in the steps of an algorithm.

35
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,980
Don't write unnecessary statements. See algorithm is like a procedure. So there are

36
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,680
many procedure. Like a chemistry experiment done by the students in the

37
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,580
laboratory is a procedure. And physics experiment done by the students in the

38
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:55,900
laboratory is also procedure. Or if you take a procedure for preparing a dish,

39
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,600
cooking a dish that is a recipe that's also procedure. And every procedure the

40
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,200
names I have given you, examples I have given you, every procedure needs some

41
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,680
input. Like chemical experiment needs some chemicals and the apparatus and

42
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,260
physics experiment needs in instruments and the recipe needs some

43
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:21,240
ingredients. Then objective of that procedure is to give some result. You

44
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,160
are cooking and cooking but no dish is prepared. Nothing like that. You are

45
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,160
doing some experiment but no solution is obtained in chemistry experiment. No

46
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,560
there must be some solution. So definitely there must be some solution. At least one

47
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:39,100
solution. Definiteness. All the steps that you are doing are known step only.

48
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,860
You are not doing anything magical. Right? Known steps you are performing.

49
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,040
Every step that you are doing here is known step and it's nothing is

50
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:58,100
magical. Right? Only known steps you are performing. And finiteness. If you are

51
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,180
preparing a dish you will stop at some point and the dish is ready. If

52
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,520
you are doing a chemical experiment you will stop at some point and the

53
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,120
solution is ready. Definitely. And effectiveness. Effectiveness. You will

54
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,680
not do anything unnecessary while doing this procedure. Like you are

55
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,560
boiling some chemical and but you're not using it in the experiment. It's

56
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,120
not mixed with the solution. You are cutting some vegetables in the recipe

57
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,080
but that is not used in the dish. So there is unnecessary things are not

58
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,760
done in the procedure. So here also in the algorithm you should not have any

59
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,820
unnecessary statements.
