00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,360
Hi, now one more recurrence relation I'll solve I have not written any algorithm directly

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:14,240
I have taken a recurrence relation and this is dividing function tn is divided. I'll solve this using

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,420
recursion tree method

4
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,140
See tn

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,660
There are two steps in this one

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,420
tn by 2 and

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,040
n

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:33,100
n is the time taken in this step plus the time taken here also

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:41,560
Then what this will be this will be taking n by 2 time and also it will be tn by 2 square

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:49,040
Then what this will be it will be taking n by 2 square time

11
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,060
and

12
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,060
tn by 2 cube

13
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,720
This way I'll be go on reducing

14
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:03,540
I'll be go on reducing. How long how long and for k times

15
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:09,070
n by 2 power k times. I'll repeat until here

16
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,600
Then when it is n by 2 power k

17
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,160
I assume that this has became 1 because what is the smaller value I have n equal to 1

18
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,000
So I assume that I have reduced it up to 1

19
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,360
Now what this will be

20
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,140
If I take these times and add them in each step

21
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,520
So it will be n and it is n by 2

22
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:42,100
It's n by 2 square and goes on to n by 2 power k

23
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:50,240
Right see the last step will be n by 2 power k, right

24
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,560
See, this is n cube and this is n square

25
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,440
So this will be last will be 2 power k minus 1

26
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:02,220
So for this some something will be there some function will be there here and it will be n by 2 power

27
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,720
k minus 1 and when it is n by 2 power k it stops, so

28
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,580
Approximately I am taking it till n by 2 power k or k minus 1 also I can take it

29
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,920
Now, let me add all these

30
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:23,540
To get the answer. So this is n plus n by 2 plus n by 2 square

31
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,520
plus n by 2 cube

32
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,000
Plus goes on to n by 2 power k

33
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,220
This will be Tn

34
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,920
What this is equal to n common

35
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:47,800
1 plus 1 by 2 plus 1 by 2 square plus 1 by 2 cube plus goes on to

36
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,540
1 by 2 power k

37
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,060
This is n sigma

38
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:05,840
1 by 2 power i, i takes the values from 0 to k

39
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,380
What is this equal to this will be equal to 1?

40
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,760
Remember this this will be equal to 1 so this is n into 1 so Tn answer is n

41
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:26,200
So this is big O of n or theta of n anything you can say for explanation

42
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,640
I'll take one circle

43
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,080
and

44
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,000
This is half of a circle

45
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,400
this is

46
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,160
1 4th of a circle

47
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,160
This is 1 8th of a circle

48
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,340
This is 1 16th of a circle if I continue goes on so it means 1 by 2 plus

49
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,840
1 by 2 square plus

50
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,760
1 by 2 cube plus 1 by 2 power 4 plus goes on up to

51
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:00,140
Infinity if I add all these pieces it is equal to one circle is one circle

52
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,280
Half 1 4th 1 8 and all if you add them up to infinity is 1 so this is

53
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,940
Approximately equal to 1 so we round it up to 1 n into 1 so it is order of n

54
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:23,120
So this is one method now next method. I'll use substitution method now using substitution method

55
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,550
Tn is equals to

56
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,170
Tn by 2 plus n

57
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,600
If I use this method also, I will get the same series in the tree

58
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,420
I was getting it vertically and and I was adding it here. I will get it horizontally

59
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,800
the same

60
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,620
What is the Tn by 2?

61
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,580
this will be

62
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,410
Tn by 2 square plus n by 2 and

63
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,740
This is n

64
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,940
If I open it

65
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:10,080
Tn by 2 square plus n by 2 plus n if this was the first equation

66
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,940
Then this is the second equation

67
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:19,740
I'm not showing you here how to substitute and get the next expression next equation

68
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,440
Already we have done in previous recurrence relation. Maybe you have watched them

69
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,760
Next

70
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:34,860
If I substitute this further, then this will be Tn by 2 cube plus n

71
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,660
by 2 square plus n by 2

72
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:44,660
Plus n if I continue for k times, so then it will be

73
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:50,680
Tn by 2 power k plus n by 2 power k minus 1

74
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,880
plus n by 2 power k minus 2

75
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,740
plus goes on to n by 2 plus n

76
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:06,500
That's it I am getting the same thing what is this equal to this is equal to 1

77
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,380
Tn is equals to

78
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,420
Tn by 2 power k plus

79
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,140
n by 2 power k minus 1

80
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:22,080
plus goes on to n by 2 square plus n by 2

81
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,320
plus n we assume that

82
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:28,960
n

83
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,340
By 2 power k is equals to 1 we say that this we have reached till 1 and equal to 1

84
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:40,160
Therefore n equal to 2 power k and k is equals to log n

85
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,820
If I substitute this in this recurrence relation

86
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:51,760
Then this is a T1 plus n is a common 1 by 2 power k minus 1 plus 1 by 2 power

87
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,220
k minus 2 plus goes on to 1 by 2 plus 1

88
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:03,340
Then what is this approximately equal to Tn plus this is 1 plus n

89
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:08,780
And this whole thing is 1 and this plus 1 is also there plus 1

90
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,420
So this is 1 plus 2n

91
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,400
This is big O of n

92
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,360
Now the answer is same order of n
