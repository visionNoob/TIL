00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,700
hello friends this is the next video on recurrence relation and the type of

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:11,420
recurrence relation is a decreasing function so already I have made one

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:17,720
video on recurrence relation or this is the second video see the title I have

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:23,700
given as recurrence relation decreasing function so one two three so

5
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,180
you can see all those functions so each functions is each function is

6
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,160
covered in a separate video now here I have a function it's a recursive

7
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,860
function when n is passed it is calling itself for n minus 1 then inside this

8
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:46,770
there is a loop for loop is there let us find out what's the time so for

9
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:56,990
this I will say this takes tn time then how much time this loop takes so I

10
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:03,150
try to take details this condition takes one unit of time and this for we have

11
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:09,450
been writing n plus 1 and whatever is there inside will execute for n times

12
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:20,150
then what about this statement this will execute for tn minus 1 time then

13
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:27,810
what is the recurrence relation if I write this one then tn is equals to

14
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:42,090
sum of all these so tn is equals to tn minus 1 plus 2n plus 2 this what

15
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:50,690
the recurrence relation I got but if I take it in this form it will not be

16
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:58,010
easy for me to solve it so this part of a relation we have to take a

17
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:03,230
asymptotic notation of that one means I should round round it up I

18
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:08,990
should not take 2n plus 2 so what is the notation for that it is big O of n

19
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:15,310
or theta of n also I can say it belongs to a linear class degree 1 so

20
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:24,930
that I can frame it as tn is equals to tn minus 1 plus n

21
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:38,970
instead of writing 2n plus 2 I can simply write n now this is the

22
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:50,650
recurrence relation see tn is equals to tn minus 1 plus n for n greater than 0

23
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:57,650
if it is greater than 0 and when n is equals to 0 what it is doing it is

24
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:04,010
doing nothing so I can say some constant or I will call it as 1 for

25
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:09,290
instead of constant I am writing it as 1 right or you can take C or anything

26
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:15,510
there so that's it so here we have learned how to prepare a recurrence

27
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:24,990
relation from a given algorithm or a function now this recurrence relation I

28
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:38,620
will solve it using recursion tree tn tn it is taking n amount of time this one

29
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:45,900
loop is taking n amount of time and also it is calling itself tn minus 1

30
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:54,540
then what about this step see that is printing n times so I have not

31
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,460
written print here I am saying that that statement is taking n times so I

32
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:06,540
wrote just time I'm not tracing it I am preparing a tree now this will be n

33
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:16,020
minus 1 and again it will call itself n minus 2 then this will be n minus 2

34
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:20,540
times this loop will repeat because now the value passed is n minus 2 and this

35
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:30,280
will be tn minus 3 continue if I continue like this then where it will

36
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:37,360
stop this n will reduce by 1 every time and it reach till 0 why because we

37
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,740
know the value of n is equals to 0 when n is equals to 0 answer is 1 so

38
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,820
that is the smallest value that we know so we say that it is reducing up to

39
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:53,600
t2 that time it will print 2 times and t1 and for t1 it will print that loop

40
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:03,560
will run for one time and this is t0 for t0 it does nothing that's it so

41
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,140
what is the amount of time taken here see if you compare this one with

42
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:12,780
the previous example in the previous video you can find that printf was

43
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,280
there so I was printing the value but no I am not printing the value I am

44
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,100
saying that this statement will take an amount of time because it is printing

45
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:26,540
n values instead of writing all n values I am just writing time now let

46
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:31,260
us find out the time how much time it is taking in this step n then the

47
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:36,760
what about this step n minus 1 time and then call so n minus 1 time and

48
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:41,920
this call is there so this call is taking how much time n minus 2 and then

49
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:48,580
n minus 3 so this will take how much time n minus 3 goes on this will take

50
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:54,980
how much time 2 and 1 then 0 if I sum up all these things then it will be

51
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:06,060
0 plus 1 plus 2 plus from here I am adding then goes on to n minus 1 plus n

52
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:16,700
what is this n into n plus 1 by 2 so the total time here see the time for this

53
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:22,660
one is n plus this time how much is this time n minus 1 plus this time so I

54
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:27,700
have added all of them so the total time is n into n plus 1 by 2 so tn we

55
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:40,220
got the answer as n into n plus 1 by 2 and this is n square now write theta we

56
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:49,060
go whatever it is it is n square so the time taken by this algorithm is n

57
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:59,620
square this is using tree method I have solved this right so see by practicing

58
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,760
you get the idea you don't have to elaborate it this much quickly you can

59
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,400
get the jump on to the answer so just you need to practice few functions

60
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,140
and recurrence relations and get the answer then you can directly give the

61
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:19,100
answer you don't have to solve all these huh when you are writing a theory

62
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,340
examination where you have to write essay type questions there you may have

63
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:30,720
to write on all these steps and then prove that it is n square if it is

64
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,320
objective type question direct answer you need so there is a method to know

65
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:41,100
the direct answer also we will be looking at this in coming videos now I

66
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:47,180
will show you another method that is back substitution or induction method so

67
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,820
that is back substitution by substitution we will solve this one so

68
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:56,840
I'll remove this and I will solve just recurrence relation now let us solve

69
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:09,990
this one tn is equals to tn minus 1 plus n I can move this one if I can

70
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:18,830
find out this so what is this since tn is equals to tn minus 1 plus n therefore

71
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:31,010
what a tn minus 1 will be tn minus 2 plus n minus 1 isn't it see n in case

72
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:35,430
of n in place of n n minus 1 so in place of n n minus 1 already minus 1

73
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:42,170
is there so n minus 2 then plus in place of n n minus 1 now I know this one

74
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:48,010
so instead of n minus 1 I can take this and substitute it here or this

75
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:59,810
becomes tn is equals to what is this tn minus 2 plus n minus 1 plus n as it

76
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:15,050
is if I open the brackets tn is equals to tn minus 2 plus n minus 1 and n

77
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:20,430
remember one thing whenever you are solving this one don't add it becomes

78
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:24,790
2 n minus 1 if it becomes 2 n minus 1 it will be difficult for you to find

79
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:31,590
out a formula for this one or a single expression for this sequence actually we

80
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,390
will be getting a sequence so based on that sequence we have to prepare a

81
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:40,570
formula if you add you'll be getting just a single one or two terms so from

82
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:50,050
that we cannot figure out the formula so better avoid adding these terms so if

83
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:55,230
this was the starting equation now after first substitution this is the second

84
00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:00,970
equation I got now further I will substitute I need to know the value of

85
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:07,330
this so here only I will continue so what if I write n as n minus 2

86
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:14,390
instead of n if I write n minus 2 then this will be n minus 3 plus n minus 2

87
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:20,990
instead of n it is n minus 2 instead of n minus 2 sorry n minus 1 n minus 2

88
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:25,390
minus 1 so n minus 3 and this n minus 2 directly so in place of in this

89
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:30,270
equation only the first one only I have just kept n minus 1 in place of n

90
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:37,770
so you got this one so this part I will substitute it here so what I get

91
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:49,590
tn is equals to in brackets tn minus 3 plus n minus 2 plus outside n

92
00:10:49,670 --> 00:11:03,090
minus 1 plus n open this one tn is equals to tn minus 3 plus n minus 2

93
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:16,890
plus n minus 1 plus n this is the third equation see after doing it for two

94
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:21,970
times then you can come on go to k steps and then you can get the formula

95
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:26,410
this is the method followed in induction right so we are substituting

96
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:32,490
the value so induction or substitution whatever you call it so I have done it

97
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:38,330
for two times now from this I can observe and say if I do it for k times

98
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:44,330
what will happen see when first equation it was n minus 1 and n this

99
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:50,410
was second equation n minus 2 and then n minus 1 and n two terms n minus

100
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:58,910
3 n minus 2 then 1 then n if I do it for k times what happens I'll use this

101
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:09,730
part yes if I continue this for k times let us see what I'll get tn is

102
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:18,950
equals to tn minus k instead of n minus 3 I am writing n minus k plus n

103
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:26,630
minus 2 this was 3 so it will be 2 1 less than this one so if this is a k

104
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:38,620
then this will be n minus k minus 1 this was 3 so that is 2 the next will

105
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:53,300
be n minus k minus 2 and goes on to n minus 1 and n so this is the fourth

106
00:12:53,300 --> 00:13:03,950
one I got right this is the fourth one this is up to k now I assume that I

107
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:10,530
have reached till n minus k so I assume that I have reached till 0 and is 0 so

108
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:24,770
assume n minus k this one has became 0 therefore n is equals to k now

109
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:31,430
in place of k if I substitute n in this one let us see what I get tn is equals

110
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:41,770
to this one tn minus n plus n minus I'll open this so this becomes minus

111
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:46,930
n plus 1 so instead of k I am writing n and then I am opening the

112
00:13:46,930 --> 00:14:00,190
ragged plus n minus n plus 2 then goes on last terms will be n minus 1 plus n

113
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:07,310
these two last terms as it is there is no k here now simplified further tn is

114
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:17,090
equals to t0 plus this nn gets cancelled 1 plus nn gets cancelled 2 so it means I

115
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:23,230
can figure out the next term is a 3 yes it is a 3 then goes on up to what

116
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:33,450
n minus 1 plus n that's it so what is this I got what is this I got this

117
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:43,770
is sum of first and natural numbers then tn is equals to t0 is what 1 plus

118
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:56,130
this is n into n plus 1 by 2 that's it if you compare the three method

119
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:01,910
there also I got n into n plus 1 by 2 but here I got one extra because this

120
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:07,790
is giving me calls number of calls actually so plus 1 call extra anyway

121
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:16,370
almost at the same thing so what is this this is theta of n square theta of

122
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:22,890
n square that's it I have solved this second one by using recursive tree

123
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:28,210
method as well as by substitution method and we got the same answer it's

124
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:32,070
order of n square so in this video we have learned how to write a

125
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:36,430
recurrence relation for any algorithm or a function then how to solve that

126
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,850
recurrence relation to get the answer so we saw two different methods

127
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:44,710
for solving it this useful for understanding the procedure how to solve

128
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:52,230
it and also useful for that is theory exams right but for objective type

129
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:56,490
questions you should know directly how to get the answer that will be

130
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,750
learning in next videos
