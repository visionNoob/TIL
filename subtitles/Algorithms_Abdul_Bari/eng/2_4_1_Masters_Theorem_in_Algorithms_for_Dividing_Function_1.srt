00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Hi, let us look at Masters theorem for dividing function.

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,820
So the Masters theorem, we take a recurrence relation in general form.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,580
So the general form of recurrence relation is

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:23,500
Tn is equals to Atn by b plus f of n.

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,880
And we assume that a is greater than or equal to 1

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,320
means at least it must be 1

7
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,740
and b is greater than 1

8
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:39,000
and f of n we say that it is of the form

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,900
theta n power k log n whole to the power of p.

10
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,360
We assume this is the general form.

11
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,220
Now from this we will find out two values.

12
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:59,060
First is log a base b

13
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:05,320
and the second is k, k that is power of n.

14
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,360
See there are different methods here.

15
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,640
Sometime we take a and b power k.

16
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,120
First value is a and the next value is b power k.

17
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,260
I am taking log a base b and n. This will be more easy.

18
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,060
Now based on these two values, there are three cases.

19
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:37,880
Case 1, if log a base b is greater than k,

20
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:46,840
then answer is theta of n power log a base b.

21
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,810
So we get the answer in theta otherwise we can take big O also.

22
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,730
This is first case.

23
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:07,030
Case 2, if log a base b is equal to k,

24
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:08,990
these two are same.

25
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,510
That is log a base b and power of n in function n,

26
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:18,030
whatever the power of n in function n, both are same, equal.

27
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,090
Then again it has three cases.

28
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:27,570
If p is greater than minus 1,

29
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,290
means p is not a negative,

30
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:42,550
then answer is n power k and log of p plus 1, n.

31
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:47,710
So whatever the p value is, it is raised for one more time.

32
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,550
Means that whole thing is multiplied by log n.

33
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,410
I am just writing the conditions.

34
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,190
Mostly you find these conditions in textbooks.

35
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,530
So I am writing the conditions.

36
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,850
Then I will take the examples and I will show you.

37
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,690
If p is equal to minus 1,

38
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:14,810
then this is theta of n power k log of log n.

39
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:21,290
And if p is less than minus 1,

40
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,630
then this is theta of just n power k.

41
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,930
We will discard log n.

42
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,690
So there are three sub cases in case 2.

43
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,370
If these two are equal, then these are three sub cases.

44
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,250
Then case 3.

45
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:44,090
If log a base b is less than k,

46
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,330
then this n power k is greater.

47
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,390
Again there are two cases here.

48
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:58,750
If p is greater than or equal to 0,

49
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:06,250
then answer is theta of n power k log n power p.

50
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,490
Means as it is. Same thing.

51
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,050
And if p is less than 0,

52
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:18,070
then it is big O of n power k.

53
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,170
Just we will take n power k and discard log n.

54
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,250
That's it.

55
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,490
Now let me take some examples and show you.

56
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:33,150
I will make it more simple for understanding this one through examples.

57
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,370
So let us solve few examples.

58
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:41,710
Let us take some recurrence relation that are satisfying case 1.

59
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:51,550
So Tn is equal to 2Tn by 2 plus 1.

60
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,230
What is a here?

61
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,630
What is b here?

62
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:58,410
That is 2.

63
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,130
What is f of n?

64
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,490
This is theta of 1.

65
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,470
What is this theta of 1?

66
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,710
Theta of 1 is n power 0.

67
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,910
Is there any log n?

68
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,770
No, there is no log n.

69
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:15,790
So for that also I will take log power 0.

70
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:21,410
See, this one is n power 0 and log n power 0 also.

71
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,530
Both are 0.

72
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:32,490
Now from this, I will find out log a base b and n power k.

73
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:33,910
So what is k here?

74
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,130
k is 0.

75
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,970
So k is 0 and p is also 0.

76
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,070
So what is log a base b?

77
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:44,470
Log 2 base 2 is 1 and k is 0.

78
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,790
See, log a base b is greater than k.

79
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,730
This satisfies first condition k is 1.

80
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,990
What is that answer I have to write?

81
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:01,390
The answer I have to write is theta of n power log a base b.

82
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,790
Log a base b is what? 1.

83
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,490
So n power 1.

84
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,790
That is it.

85
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,070
Second example.

86
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:18,310
Tn is equal to 4Tn by 2 plus n.

87
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,030
So directly I will find out these two.

88
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,990
Log 4 base 2 is what? 2.

89
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,090
Log a base b I found out directly.

90
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,770
Instead of finding out a and b and then p,

91
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,730
I have directly found out this one.

92
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,710
So what is the k? n power is what? 1.

93
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,870
What is the p? That is 0.

94
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,310
So this satisfies which case?

95
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,110
This is 2 greater than 1.

96
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,070
So it comes under case 1.

97
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,950
So theta of n power log a base b.

98
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:55,130
So theta of n power 2.

99
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,710
Now third example for the same case 1.

100
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:11,710
Tn is equal to 8Tn by 2 plus n.

101
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,900
Log 8 base 2 is 3.

102
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,440
n power k is k is 1.

103
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,120
So 3 is greater.

104
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,660
So this is theta of n power 3.

105
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,560
That's it.

106
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,440
8 base 2 is 3 and this is 1 only.

107
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,980
Now look at this.

108
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:42,160
If the recurrence relation is Tn 8Tn by 2 plus n square.

109
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,640
So k is 2.

110
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,480
There is no p here, p is 0.

111
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,940
There is no log n here.

112
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,880
So in simple words you find out this and this

113
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,320
and find out log.

114
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,140
n power of n you see.

115
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,320
Power of n you see.

116
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,040
So power of n is 2.

117
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,020
This is 3.

118
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,980
So still this is greater.

119
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,740
So answer is n power 3.

120
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,180
Let me change.

121
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,760
Tn is equal to 9Tn by 3 plus 1.

122
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,800
What is log 9 base 3?

123
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:17,880
This is 2.

124
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,380
What is k?

125
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,520
This is what?

126
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,380
n power 0.

127
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,640
This is n power 0.

128
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,520
k is 0.

129
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,980
So this is greater.

130
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:28,980
This is greater.

131
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,640
So the answer is theta of n power this one 2.

132
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,980
If this is n.

133
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,560
n power 1.

134
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,980
This is greater.

135
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,760
So again n square only.

136
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,400
If this is 2 then this is 2.

137
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,720
So this is not greater.

138
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,700
They are equal.

139
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,460
So they come under case 2.

140
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,840
So as long as this is greater

141
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,600
whatever the result you are getting directly put it here.

142
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,420
Let us quickly look at some examples.

143
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:08,140
Suppose this is 4n by 2 and this is n.

144
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,680
What is this 4 base 2?

145
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,020
Log 4 base 2?

146
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:12,380
2.

147
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,840
And this is 1.

148
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,280
So answer will be theta of n square only.

149
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,380
If this is 8.

150
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,620
8 base 2.

151
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:22,880
Q.

152
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,020
This is 1 only.

153
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,440
So this will be Q.

154
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,740
If you have 8 here.

155
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,320
And here it is n log n.

156
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,880
So just we see power of n.

157
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,000
n power k.

158
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:41,840
k you check.

159
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,300
So this is 1.

160
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,640
This is 8 base 2.

161
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,080
3.

162
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,100
So this is greater.

163
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,380
As long as log a base b is greater than power of n.

164
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,200
Power of n in function f of n.

165
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,500
We take log a base b only.

166
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,400
Alright.

167
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,680
Next we will look at second case.

168
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:11,680
Tn is equals to 2tn by 2 plus n.

169
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,780
Log 2 base 2 is 1.

170
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,200
And k is 1.

171
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,820
So this is.

172
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,960
They are equal.

173
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,860
Then what is the p here?

174
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,080
There is no log n.

175
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,400
So p is 0.

176
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,280
P is 0.

177
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:28,680
Right?

178
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,080
So this is p is greater than minus 1.

179
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,060
So what it should be?

180
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:37,080
n power k and log p plus 1.

181
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,700
So whatever n is.

182
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,220
n log n.

183
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,300
So p was 0.

184
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,260
So I made it as 1.

185
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,280
Now in simple terms I will explain you.

186
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,120
Just watch this.

187
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,540
Don't look at this one.

188
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,000
Right?

189
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,400
Later you can look at.

190
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,660
You can pause and rewind and you can go through this one.

191
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,780
So simply I will explain this one.

192
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,760
Look at this.

193
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,520
2 base 2 is 1.

194
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,900
n power is 1.

195
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,500
So whatever f of n is.

196
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,900
Multiplied by log n.

197
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:08,500
Simple.

198
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:09,940
N of p.

199
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:10,700
Right?

200
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,560
This is what we found in the book.

201
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,020
So unless I show this.

202
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,400
You may not feel that I am showing Master's Theorem.

203
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,620
That is the reason I have written it.

204
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:19,620
Okay?

205
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,180
It can be made more simple.

206
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,340
So watch this one.

207
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,380
Now if this is 4 by 2 and n square.

208
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,500
This is 4 by 2 is what?

209
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,080
2.

210
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,320
k is how much?

211
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:31,720
2.

212
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,820
Both are same.

213
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,320
So what I should do?

214
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,800
n square log n.

215
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,780
This is the answer.

216
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,760
If suppose already I have log n.

217
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,300
So again you multiply by log n.

218
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,340
So log square n.

219
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,340
n square log n.

220
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,140
So multiply by n square log n again.

221
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,080
If suppose already this is n square log n.

222
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,420
So make it as log cubed.

223
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,120
So it means when these two are equal.

224
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,200
Log n base b and n power.

225
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,060
Not log.

226
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,480
n power is same.

227
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,310
Then take this as it is multiplied by log n.

228
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:12,180
Right?

229
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,860
Take this as it is and multiply by log n.

230
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,200
Suppose this is log power 5.

231
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,440
Make it 6.

232
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,660
Now I will write few more.

233
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,280
See.

234
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,280
8 log base 2 and n cube.

235
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,740
So what is this?

236
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,400
8 base 2 is what?

237
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:32,800
3.

238
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,340
What is n power k?

239
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,800
n power k.

240
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,400
k is what?

241
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:36,780
3.

242
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,060
Both are equal.

243
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:38,620
3, 3.

244
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,440
Both are equal.

245
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,600
So the answer is what?

246
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,240
n power 3.

247
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,440
Log n.

248
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,140
Take that n power 3.

249
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,340
Whatever f of n is.

250
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,180
Multiplied by log n.

251
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,220
That's it.

252
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,920
This is case 2.

253
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,080
In that first one I have shown you.

254
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,080
Now I suppose the recurrence relation is like this.

255
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:09,080
2 t n by 2 plus n by log n.

256
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,680
Then all the 2 base 2 is 1.

257
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,460
k power power of n is 1.

258
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,900
k is 1.

259
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,900
But what is the p value?

260
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,020
p is, this is in denominator.

261
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,360
So it is minus 1.

262
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,360
Then what I should do?

263
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,600
I told you that if these 2 are equal.

264
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,520
They are same.

265
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,240
This is 1.

266
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:31,920
This is 1.

267
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,900
Then directly take f of n and multiply it by log n.

268
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,620
If I do that then log n log n gets cancelled.

269
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,640
No, don't do that.

270
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,380
Here the method is little different.

271
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:45,300
So take it as theta of n as it is.

272
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:49,360
Instead of log n make it as log of log n.

273
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,980
This is the answer.

274
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,380
This is what this method says.

275
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,920
If it is equal to minus 1.

276
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,680
So p is minus 1.

277
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,300
So this I can write it as into log minus 1 n.

278
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,800
So this one.

279
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,420
And even in the same situation.

280
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,940
If this is denominator is log square n.

281
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:21,180
Then this will be into log minus 2 n.

282
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,680
So this will be too small.

283
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,360
This will be too small.

284
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,440
Minus 2.

285
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,020
Right?

286
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,200
Then in this case it is less than minus 1.

287
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,860
Less than minus 1.

288
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,720
So in that case don't take this log of log n also.

289
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,880
Don't take log of log n also.

290
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,600
That is power 2 power 3 something.

291
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:44,880
Then ignore it.

292
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,980
Just take this one.

293
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:46,880
That's all.

294
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:49,560
Right?

295
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,720
These are the 3 sub cases in case 2.

296
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,000
The third case I will show you.

297
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:02,640
Tn is equal to Tn by 2 plus n square.

298
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,640
What is A base B?

299
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,580
Log 1 base 2 is 0.

300
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,420
And k is 2.

301
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,400
So this is smaller than this one.

302
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,080
This is greater.

303
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,420
So this is theta of n square.

304
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,500
Theta of n square.

305
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:23,600
Right?

306
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,280
If this is 2 base 2.

307
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,580
2 base 2 is 1.

308
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,020
Still this is greater.

309
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,180
Answer is n square.

310
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,040
And if suppose this is having log n.

311
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,540
Then take log n as it is.

312
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,920
If you are having log square n, take log square n as it is.

313
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,360
Whatever it is, you take this one.

314
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,940
Power of n is greater than this log A base B.

315
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,740
So take directly f of n.

316
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,720
It is very simple.

317
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,120
Take f of n.

318
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,920
This is f of n only.

319
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,880
Power of k is greater than directly take it.

320
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:01,820
Okay?

321
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,180
n square log square n.

322
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,100
That is already directly have taken it.

323
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:09,900
Okay?

324
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,760
Then, if this is suppose 4n by 2 and this is 3.

325
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,760
So this is a 2 you see and this is a 3.

326
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,320
So the answer is n cube.

327
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,800
That is greater.

328
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,200
So whatever it is along with that if you have log also you take it.

329
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,500
But one thing.

330
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,000
If that is having log in the denominator.

331
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,500
But this is greater.

332
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,340
So don't take the denominator.

333
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,800
Just take n power 3.

334
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:41,900
That's it.

335
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,040
Right?

336
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:49,260
These are the cases and I have shown with some examples.
